Deploying a React frontend, Spring Boot backend, and MySQL database on free platforms is achievable with a few key services. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **React Frontend Deployment** on **Vercel** or **Netlify**
   - **Vercel** and **Netlify** both offer free hosting for frontend applications.
   - To deploy a React app:
     1. Create a GitHub/GitLab repository for your React app.
     2. Push your code to the repository.
     3. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), create an account, and link it to your GitHub/GitLab.
     4. Choose the repository to import and follow the steps to deploy it.
     5. Vercel/Netlify will automatically detect your React app and build it.

### 2. **Spring Boot Backend Deployment** on **Render** or **Railway**
   - **Render** and **Railway** are excellent options for deploying a Spring Boot API for free.
   - Here’s how to do it:
     1. Create a repository for your Spring Boot project.
     2. Push your Spring Boot code to the repository.
     3. Go to [Render](https://render.com/) or [Railway](https://railway.app/) and sign up.
     4. Create a new service, link it to your GitHub repository, and set up the build command (e.g., `./gradlew build` or `mvn clean install`) and start command (e.g., `java -jar target/your-app.jar`).
     5. Configure any environment variables required for the backend, like the database URL, username, and password.

### 3. **MySQL Database Deployment** on **Clever Cloud** or **PlanetScale**
   - For a free MySQL database, **Clever Cloud** and **PlanetScale** provide easy-to-deploy options:
     1. **Clever Cloud**: Go to [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) and sign up. Add a new application and select a MySQL database. You’ll get the database URL, username, and password.
     2. **PlanetScale**: Go to [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) and create a new database. PlanetScale uses a non-blocking database branching strategy, and you can connect it with any MySQL-compatible application.

### 4. **Connecting Spring Boot to the MySQL Database**
   - In your Spring Boot `application.properties` or `application.yml`, add:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<DATABASE_URL>:3306/<DATABASE_NAME>
     spring.datasource.username=<USERNAME>
     spring.datasource.password=<PASSWORD>
     spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     ```
   - Replace `<DATABASE_URL>`, `<DATABASE_NAME>`, `<USERNAME>`, and `<PASSWORD>` with the credentials from your MySQL database.

### 5. **Linking Frontend to Backend**
   - Update the API endpoints in your React app to point to the backend URL provided by Render or Railway. Make sure to handle any CORS issues by configuring Spring Boot with:
     ```java
     @Configuration
     public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
         @Override
         public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
             registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("<Frontend_URL>");
         }
     }
     ```
   - Replace `<Frontend_URL>` with your deployed React URL.

### 6. **Testing the Deployment**
   - Once all services are deployed and connected, test your React app to ensure it can access the Spring Boot API and that the backend connects to the MySQL database successfully.

Using these services, you can deploy your full-stack application with no cost. Deploying a React frontend on Vercel is straightforward and can be done in just a few steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Deploying on Vercel

1. **Prepare Your React Project**
   - Make sure your React project is ready for deployment. Check that it runs properly locally by using:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Run a production build to ensure there are no errors:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

2. **Push Your Code to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket)**
   - Create a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
   - Initialize Git in your local project if you haven’t already:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - Push your code to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
     git push -u origin main
     ```

3. **Create a Vercel Account**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign up or log in. You can log in using your GitHub account for easy repository access.

4. **Import Your GitHub Repository to Vercel**
   - From your Vercel dashboard, click on **New Project**.
   - Select **Import Git Repository**.
   - Choose the GitHub repository that contains your React app.

5. **Configure Project Settings**
   - After selecting your repository, Vercel will detect your project settings.
   - Ensure that the framework is set to **React** (or leave it as **Automatic**).
   - Review the default build command (usually `npm run build`) and the output directory (`build`).
   - If you have any environment variables (like API URLs), add them here under **Environment Variables**.

6. **Deploy Your Project**
   - Click on **Deploy** to start the build process. Vercel will:
     - Clone your repository.
     - Run the build command to create a production-ready build.
     - Deploy the build to a Vercel subdomain.

7. **View Your Live Site**
   - Once the build and deployment are complete, Vercel will provide a live URL for your site, like `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`.
   - You can view your deployed React app by visiting this URL.

### Notes
- **Automatic Deployments**: Every time you push changes to the main branch of your repository, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy the updated version.
- **Custom Domain (Optional)**: You can add a custom domain from the **Settings** tab if you have one.

Your React frontend is now live on Vercel! Let me know if you'd like help with any other steps.


The message you're seeing indicates that Docker Desktop doesn’t recognize any WSL 2 distributions to integrate with, even though it shows the `docker-desktop` distribution under `wsl --list --verbose`. It’s possible that the default WSL distribution is either not set up or is set to WSL 1, which is incompatible with Docker Desktop. Here’s how to resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Install or Convert a WSL Distro to WSL 2
1. **Install a new WSL 2 Linux distribution:**
   - Open **Microsoft Store** and search for a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu).
   - Install the distribution.
   - Once installed, open it to complete the setup.

2. **Convert an existing WSL 1 distribution to WSL 2:**
   - In PowerShell, list your installed distributions to check their versions:
     ```sh
     wsl --list --verbose
     ```
   - For any distribution listed with "Version 1", convert it to WSL 2 by running:
     ```sh
     wsl --set-version <distribution_name> 2
     ```
     Replace `<distribution_name>` with the name of the distribution you want to convert, such as `Ubuntu`.

3. **Set the default version to WSL 2** (optional but recommended if you plan to use WSL 2 by default):
   ```sh
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

### Step 2: Enable WSL Integration in Docker Desktop
1. Once you have a WSL 2 distribution installed and running, open **Docker Desktop**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Resources** > **WSL Integration**.
3. Enable **integration with your default WSL distro** and ensure the checkbox for the distribution (e.g., `Ubuntu`) is selected.
4. Click **Apply & Restart**.

### Step 3: Verify Docker Is Working
1. Open your WSL 2 distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) from the Start menu or Microsoft Store.
2. In the terminal, run the following command to check if Docker is accessible:
   ```sh
   docker --version
   ```
   If Docker is working correctly, it should return the Docker version information.

### Additional Note
If you still see the error or Docker doesn't start, try restarting your computer after completing these steps. Sometimes, Docker requires a system reboot to recognize new WSL configurations.
